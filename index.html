            <h1>Star</h1>
            <h2>
              Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most 
              fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of 
              the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. 
              Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements
              such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied 
              to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them. Consequently, 
              the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.<br><br>
              Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar 
              example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these clouds 
              gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under 
              its own gravitational attraction. As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins 
              to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud 
              that will one day become a star. Three-dimensional computer models of star formation predict 
              that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs; 
              this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in groups of multiple stars.

              Stars and Their Fates
            </h1>
            <h2>In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, although all but the most massive 
              stars live for billions of years. When a star has fused all the hydrogen in its core, 
              nuclear reactions cease. Deprived of the energy production needed to support it, the core 
              begins to collapse into itself and becomes much hotter. Hydrogen is still available outside the 
              core, so hydrogen fusion continues in a shell surrounding the core. The increasingly hot core 
              also pushes the outer layers of the star outward, causing them to expand and cool, transforming 
              the star into a red giant.</h2>

                How many stars are there in the universe?<br>

               <h2>
                There are approximately 200 billion trillion stars in the universe. Or, to put it another way, 200 sextillion.
